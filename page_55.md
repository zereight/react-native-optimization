React  Compiler  is  built  for  universal  React  but  primarily  tested  in  web 
environments. Enabling it in React Native might require additional steps to ensure 
Memo  badges appear correctly.
Since React Native includes its own version of  react-devtools, you may need 
to override it in your package.json and ensure it's updated to version 6.0.1 or 
newer. Without this, Memo  badges may not appear.
To check your React DevTools backend version, open DevTools and click the  
settings icon.
