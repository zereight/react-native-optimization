HOW TO MEASURE JS FPS
Mobile users expect smooth, well-designed interfaces that respond instantly and provide clear 
visual feedback. As a result, applications often include numerous animations that must run 
alongside other processes, such as data fetching and state management. If your application fails 
to provide a responsive interface, lags user input, or feels "janky" at times, it's a sign the UI is 
"dropping frames". Users hate it.
What is FPS
Getting your code to display anything on the screen involves compiling the code to an executable 
format, which, using various techniques, draws pixels on the screen. A single drawing is called 
a "frame". If you want your UI not to be static—which you do—your app will need to draw 
many frames every second. Most mobile devices have a refresh rate of 60 Hz, meaning they can 
display 60 frames per second, or 60 FPS. That's our metric.
