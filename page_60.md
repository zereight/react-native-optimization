BEST PRACTICE
UNDERSTAND PLATFORM 
DIFFERENCES
As a JavaScript developer, you are most likely familiar with some of the popular IDEs or editors 
and stick to your favorite one while working on a project. 
However, when you start working with React Native, you might feel overwhelmed by the 
number of new IDEs and tools thrown at you in the setup guide. It's both a blessing and a side 
effect of React Native being a native framework. Because of that, once in a while, you will be 
working with both Android Studio and Xcode.
Being comfortable with these tools will help you better navigate this guide and make you more 
productive with React Native. In this guide, we will highlight commonalities across the three 
platforms, key differences, and productivity tips to enhance your workflow.
This information will help you navigate other chapters in this guide, especially when we refer 
to Android Studio, Xcode, or different build phases.
If you are using Expo to build your application, you may not need to leave your 
IDE comfort zone too often. Expo does a great job abstracting away native pieces 
by using Dev Clients, Config Plugins, and others. The contents of this guide are 
mostly relevant to projects that rely on React Native Community CLI.
Prerequisites
Before moving on, ensure you have Android Studio and/or Xcode environment ready. If you 
went through the setup guide on the React Native website, you should already have them 
installed on your machine. If you haven't done this yet, now is a great time to do it. React Native 
documentation provides an in-depth explanation, so we will skip this topic in this guide.
