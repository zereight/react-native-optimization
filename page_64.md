Here are some files to look out for:
 ■Podfile—defines dependencies required for the iOS app.
 ■Gemfile—defines CocoaPods version and other required plugins for a given React 
Native app.
 ■Pods—contains all installed dependencies fetched via CocoaPods. This folder 
is generated when you install dependencies and should typically not be committed to 
version control (it is listed in.gitignore in all React Native projects by default).
 ■.xcworkspace—the workspace file generated by CocoaPods, which must be used 
instead of .xcodeproj when opening with Xcode. It ensures that all CocoaPods-
managed dependencies are correctly linked in Xcode.
While Apple's Swift Package Manager (SPM) is an alternative for native iOS 
projects, React Native does not yet support it, making CocoaPods the default 
choice. 
Android
For Android, React Native manages dependencies using Gradle, Android's build automation 
tool. Similar to iOS, React Native-specific modules do not come from external registries 
like Maven Central or JCenter. Instead, they are referenced locally from node_modules/ and 
compiled directly into the project.
For an Android-native dependency that is not a React Native module (e.g., Glide for image 
loading), you must manually add it to the android/app/build.gradle file:
dependencies {
  implementation 'com.github.bumptech.glide:glide:4.12.0'
}
After adding a new dependency in build.gradle, you need to synchronize the Gradle project 
to fetch and apply the changes. 
While Gradle doesn't use ~>, it offers other flexible versioning options:
 ■Exact version—'com.github.bumptech.glide:glide:4.12.0'
 ■Version range (+ operator)—com.github.bumptech.glide:glide:4.+. Uses the 
latest minor or patch update within version 4.x.x, but avoids major updates.
 ■Dynamic versioning—
com.github.bumptech.glide:glide:+. Uses the latest version 
available. Generally not recommended, it may break your code unpredictably.
 ■For production apps, always use exact versions to ensure compatibility, just as 
CocoaPods' ~> prevents breaking changes in iOS projects.
