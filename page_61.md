While  every  platform—Web,  iOS,  Android—is  different,  they  share  some 
similarities. Realizing this will make your job as a React Native developer a little 
easier.
IDEs
First and foremost, when building an app, you need an editor to write and edit code, at the 
very least. For JavaScript, you typically use whatever you are the most familiar with—VSCode, 
WebStorm, Neovim—to name a few. Since these tools are rather unopinionated, it is best 
practice to have your environment configured to work with TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, and 
React. 
For Android and iOS, it is generally recommended to work with IDEs provided by Google 
and Apple, respectively. While you can write Swift or Kotlin from within VSCode, the 
aforementioned IDEs provide a more predictable and bullet-proof setup overall.
The features that those native IDEs provide out-of-the-box include:
 ■View Hierarchy Debugger—inspects and debugs UI layouts visually, allowing you to 
analyze element positioning, constraints, and rendering issues.
 ■Instrumentation & Performance Profiling—built-in tools for monitoring CPU, 
memory, battery usage, and UI responsiveness, such as Android Studio's Profiler and 
Xcode's Instruments.
 ■Advanced Debugging Tools—LLDB and GDB support in Xcode, Logcat, and 
Debugger in Android Studio, with deeper insights into stack traces, crash reports, and 
memory leaks.
 ■Seamless Gradle (Android) & Build System (Xcode) Integration—manage 
dependencies, build variants, signing, and packaging without extra setup; integrated 
workflows for code signing, app validation, and direct publishing to app stores.
 ■Automated Testing Tools—native unit and UI testing frameworks like XCTest 
(Xcode) and Espresso/JUnit (Android Studio) with built-in test runners.
We will rely on them as we walk through other guides and best practices in this part.
Dependency management
When working with a web or mobile application, we often rely on third-party modules. In 
React Native, a library can be a combination of JavaScript, iOS, and Android dependencies. 
Understanding how dependencies are managed across platforms will help when working 
directly with native modules.
React Native abstracts most of this complexity with autolinking, which automatically detects 
and links React Native-specific modules. However, autolinking only works for libraries designed 
explicitly for React Native. If a dependency has native code for iOS and Android but isn't 
structured as a React Native module, additional steps are required.
