Conventions used in this book
To better illustrate the ideas presented in this book, we've included a lot of short code snippets, 
screenshots from the tools we use, and diagrams. 
We link to external resources, such as official docs or libraries, but also to other chapters of this 
book.
To give you extra context on certain topics, we decided to put them in callouts—while not 
intended for linear reading, we highly recommend not skipping those when reading.
