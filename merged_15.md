ABOUT  THIS GUIDE
Optimizing React Native apps requires more than just intuition—it calls for 
a deep understanding of how JavaScript, native code, and platform-specific 
build processes work together. This guide provides a systematic approach to 
diagnosing and resolving performance bottlenecks, helping you develop apps 
that load fast and are always responsive to user input.
Learn   how   to   measure,   interpret,   and   optimize   Time   to   Interactive   (TTI)   and 
Frames Per Second (FPS)—the key indicators of app responsiveness and 
fluidity. Discover techniques to speed up startup times, eliminate janky 
animations, and ensure smooth UI interactions. With practical guidance on 
profiling, understanding platform differences, and implementing best 
practices, this guide will equip you with the skills to make data-driven 
optimizations and keep your React Native app running at peak performance.
