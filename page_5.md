WHY PERFORMANCE MATTERS
When building mobile apps, performance is not just a technical concern—it's a user experience 
priority. A fast, responsive app can make the difference between a delighted user and one who 
abandons your app entirely. But what does "fast" really mean? Is it about raw numbers or 
maybe a user's perception?
The user's perspective
Perceived performance is all about how fast your app feels to the user. It's not just about raw 
numbers or benchmarks—it's about creating the illusion of speed. 
In the 1940s, an office building in New York faced complaints about slow elevators. To 
address this, instead of speeding up the elevators, the building manager installed mirrors near 
the elevators. This simple change distracted people by giving them something to do (look at 
themselves), reducing perceived wait times, and effectively solving the issue. While this story 
may be more of an urban legend, the concept itself is rooted in valid psychological principles 
about perceived time and distraction that influence the feeling of how fast a particular event is.
When a mobile app takes a few seconds to load, showing a splash screen, skeleton UI, or even 
a game to play can make users feel like the app is responsive and ready to use. That's why perceived 
performance is often more important than actual performance in shaping user satisfaction.
However, focusing solely on perceived performance can be misleading. While tricks like 
animations, placeholders, or preloading content can improve the user's perception, they don't 
address the underlying performance issues. That's where measurable metrics like TTI and FPS 
show their value.
The metrics that matter: TTI and FPS
Out of the many metrics you can measure and monitor, two have the most impact on how 
users perceive the speed of your app. It's how quickly they can interact with the app described 
by TTI and how fluid the app feels when interacting with it described by FPS at a given time.
