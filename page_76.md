Perfetto
One such tool that might come in handy is Perfetto, which allows you to do system profiling, 
app tracing, and trace analysis by loading previously exported traces. It supplies Android Studio 
Trace Viewer with additional features. You can upload the trace through the online viewer 
available at ui.perfetto.dev and further inspect it from a different angle.

Knowing how to use a profiler is one of the most crucial skills you can learn to help yourself fix 
any kind of performance issue at any codebase. It's especially helpful for the code you haven't 
even written. But with the right tools, you can understand its performance characteristics and 
apply optimizations where needed.
