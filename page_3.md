HOW TO READ THIS BOOK
This book is intended for React Native developers of various levels of experience. We believe 
that both newcomers and seasoned React Native devs, regardless of whether they come from 
a web or native app development background, will find something valuable and applicable in 
their apps. 
We acknowledge that at a given time you may not be interested in all the optimizations presented 
in this book. Oftentimes, your focus will be on a specific area, such as optimizing React re-
renders. That's why, although you can read the whole book linearly, we made sure it's easy to 
open on any given chapter and get right to the topic of your interest.
What's waiting for you inside?
To make it easier for everyone to find relevant information, we split this guide into three 
parts focusing on different kinds of optimization you may be particularly interested in: the 
React side, the Native side, and overall build-time optimizations. All three parts contain an 
introduction to the main topic, detailed guides, and best practices to help you improve the 
most important metrics describing your app's performance: FPS (Frames Per Second) and TTI 
(Time to Interactive).
Here's what you can expect in each part:
 ■Introduction—where we present key topics, terms, and ideas related to the main 
topic.
 ■Guides—where we explain how to use specialized tools and measure important 
metrics.
 ■Best practices—where we show you what to do to make your app run and initialize 
faster.
