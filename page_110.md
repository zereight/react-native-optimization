Prefer using libraries offering native components
Libraries exposing native components should be your first choice. React Native has a wide 
community of developers working on open-source libraries that expose native components. 
Let's go over a few of those:
 ■React Native Screens—foundation for React Navigation's Native Stack.
 ■Zeego—beautiful, native menus for React Native + Web, inspired by Radix UI.
 ■React Native Slider—slider using native platform primitives.
 ■React Native Date Picker—date picker using native platform primitives.
And there are many more!
Replacing infinitely flexible JavaScript views with platform-native counterparts may not always 
be possible due to your app's design requirements. If a better, more performant UX alternative 
exists but requires you to adjust your design choices slightly, you may need to stand up for your 
users. Great UX is about the dialog between designers' creativity and what's physically possible 
from an engineering standpoint. Don't be afraid to voice your concerns. After all, we do it all 
for our users.
