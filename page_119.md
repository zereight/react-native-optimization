BEST PRACTICE
MAKE YOUR NATIVE 
MODULES FASTER
Native modules unlock endless possibilities in terms of things you can build in a React Native 
app. When JavaScript is not enough, you can drop into a lower-level language like Swift and 
Kotlin, which is native to the platform your app runs on. If you need to go even closer to the 
metal to unlock better performance or code reuse, you can also use C++. Let's review some of 
the best practices you can incorporate while building your next native module.
Quickly scaffold boilerplate code
Creating a new React Native library involves setting up initial boilerplate code that needs 
to handle legacy and new architecture implementations, codegen from TypeScript or Flow 
typings, and infrastructure to run, test, and publish code to npm. Thankfully, there is a great 
tool that helps you quickly scaffold a new library with everything set up for youâ€”React Native 
Builder Bob.
To use it, run the create-react-native-library command in your terminal window:
It will prompt you for necessary information, such as the package name or whether you build 
a Turbo module, Fabric view, or JavaScript library. You can also choose which languages you 
prefer to code in.
