PREFACE 
React Native has come a long way. From the early days as a promising experiment in cross-
platform development to adoption by some of the world's largest enterprises, its evolution has 
been nothing short of remarkable. The framework has matured, proving capable of handling 
the demands of high-scale applications while continuing to refine and push its technical 
boundaries.
For years, we have seen React Native introduce new features, often groundbreaking, with 
every release. Today, we see steady, low-level improvements that often enhance performance, 
stability, and scalability. These refinements reflect how React Native is being adopted more 
widely, reinforcing its role as a mature and enterprise-ready framework.
A significant milestone in this journey was the introduction of the New Architecture, which 
redefined many core aspects of the framework, including how we think about development in 
general and performance optimizations. It brought new features and best practices, enabling 
developers to build even more efficient and scalable applications. 
And so, we decided it was time to overhaul our guide to optimization completely. The landscape 
has changed, and so must our approach. Some techniques that were once essential are no 
longer relevant; others have taken on new importance. In this new edition, we aim to equip 
developers with the latest insights, tools, and strategies to make the most of React Native's 
evolving capabilities.
Whether you're an experienced React Native engineer or just getting started, this guide goes 
beyond performance best practices. It also provides essential knowledge to help you understand 
React Native in general, including what happens under the hood. We rely on that knowledge 
every day to build better, more efficient, and scalable applications, and we hope it will help you 
do the same.
